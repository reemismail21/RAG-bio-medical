## Project plan
## DATASET EXPLAINATION:
  **rag-mini-bioasq** from hugging face datasets
  -->enelpol/rag-mini-bioasq //cleaner version
  **specialized dataset for biomedical questions** as I'll build biomedical Ques ans sys
  its a reduced version of bioask dataset, already structured for training and testing RAG sys
  # The dataset provides--> 
  - **Biomedical questions**
  - **Relevant passages** from biomedical literature: info needed to answer questions
 - **Expert-written answers** to these questions: standard responses


## MILESTONES 
- **milestone 1**:data pre-processing and exploration 
- **milestone 2**:Text embedding, and vector db — *Estimated: 1 day*
